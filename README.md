This is a dynamic Car Rental Service web application built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to browse available cars, view car details, and make bookings based on their preferred dates. Key features include:

User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
Car Booking: Users can book cars for specific dates (with date validation and availability checks).
Admin Dashboard: Manage vehicles, bookings, and user data.
Responsive Design: User-friendly interface for all device sizes.
This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in web development, including database integration, form validation, and session management.
